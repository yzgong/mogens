A popular approach in computer vision-based human motion analysis has been to use 3D reconstruction of the person from multiple binary silhouette images taken from different angles. This method is known as shape-from-silhouette. For the results to be accurate, a certain number of cameras are required and they must be properly synchronised. Several datasets containing multiview image sequences of human motion are publically accessible, but the number of available actions is relatively limited. Furthermore, the ground truth for the location of joints is un- known for most of the datasets, making them less suitable for evaluating and comparing different methods. In this paper a toolset for generating synthetic silhouette data applicable for use in 3D reconstruction is pre- sented. Arbitrary camera configurations are supported, and a set of 2605 motion capture sequences can be used to generate the data. The synthetic data produced by this toolset is intended as a supplement for real data in planning, development and evaluation of shape-from-silhouette-based motion analysis methods.
